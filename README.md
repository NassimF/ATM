# ATM
An ATM using C++

## Description

* This ATM program uses command line to run.
* It can deposit, withdraw, transfer money,buy phone-charge, pay bills, and check the balance.
* In the beginning, a serial number for the account must be entered.
* The acceptable serial numbers are `94527613` and `61793582`. The passwords are `6666` and `4444` respectively.
* Too many wrong password attempts could get the card confiscated!
* Then a menu will be shown that includes all the aforementioned options. You may choose one by typing the number referring to each one.
* If the user is done, the 'Log out' option can be used.

**Any comments or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.**
